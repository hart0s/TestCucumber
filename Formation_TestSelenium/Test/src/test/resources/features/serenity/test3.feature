    Scenario Outline: Generate a random number by typing a min value greater than the max value
      When A random user sets the min value <min>
      And A random user clicks on the generate button

      * A random user verifies if the min value under the result shows <min1>
      * A random user verifies if the max value under the result shows <max1>
      * A random user verifies if the result number between <min2> and <max2> (included) is generated
      Examples:
        | min    | max    | min1        | max1        | min2 | max2 |
